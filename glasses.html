          <p>Many years ago I used to meet with my friends at a bar after work every Wednesday. At this bar there was a patio out front that was good for people watching. 
            Inside there were tables and chairs, benches lined the walls, and a bar stretched almost the whole length of the room.  It was modeled after an English 
            pub.  Everything was made of wood which gave the place a warm feel. The room was decorated with plaques and signs, portraits of landscapes or people 
            dressed in attire from the middle ages, and a shelf that contained a few books.  I think some of the books were for sale.
          </p>

        <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
          <p>Behind the bar were a large number of beer taps.  There were so many because beer was their specialty.  They didn't sell hard liquor.  You could only 
            buy beer and wine.  The beer selection was great. Not that I knew at the time.  I didn't know much about beer when I first started going there, but over
            several years I got to sample many different kinds from various brewers both imported and domestic. Mainly, because on Wednesdays when you bought the
            beer that was on special you could keep the glass for free.  The beer glasses pictured above are a few of those I collected during the years that I 
            went. I have several types of glasses (weissbier, flutes, tulips, chalices, mugs, and pint glasses)
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
          <p>On most Wednesdays my friends and I sat outside in the back.  The back was like a German biergarten. There were long wooden 
            tables and benches for customers to sit and enjoy their drinks.  There was plenty of shade from the surrounding buildings, a few trees, and umbrellas 
            scattered here and there. It was a family-friendly place where even children were welcome. It was common to see dogs people watching near their owners. 
            Sometimes my friends would bring a cake and other food for a birthday celebration. On holidays and special occasions there would be live music. I 
            have a lot of fond memories from there.
